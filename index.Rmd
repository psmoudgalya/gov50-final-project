## Project thoughts

I am interested in the fields of environmental science, sustainability, and how these fields relate to policy, economics, and markets. By collecting data of investments made by Congress-people over the last two decades, I would like to see how party affiliation may influence the types of companies that politicians invest in, especially with regards to the sustainability of these investments. To gather the relevant data for this project, I would use various data sets such as those offered by OpenSecrets, which is a nonprofit group that tracks money in US politics. I would add to these data sets by collating data from OpenSecrets with online information about how sustainable specific companies are, and by extension, how environmentally responsible the investments of US politicians are. Some factors I would like to study are the party affiliation, length in office, state, and Congress affiliation (Senate vs. House of Reps) of politicians in my dataset.
